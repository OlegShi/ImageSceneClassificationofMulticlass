# Image Scene Classification of Multiclass
##### I have been playing around with Convolutional neural network classification for natural scenes around the world.
##### The data distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }.
##### I have used 6000 taining images and 1200 validation images taken from https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification.
##### This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
